## WHAT?

I noticed that highlights were fucked up when viewed with
[nord theme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim)

So I'm trying to fix that.

### What has been done

- I changed the highlight links for `TodoContext` and `TodoProject`.

### What needs to be done

- [ ] Define new highlight groups and link them


PR's and any other help appreciated, I am a noob.
